# Global Techni

Global Techni is a full-stack e-commerce web application built with **Next.js**, **Prisma**, and **Supabase**.  
It allows customers to:

1. **Buy electronic products** (with email updates and receipts).
2. **Request mobile phone repairs** (track repair steps, get receipts).
3. **Use LOA (Lease with Option to Buy)** with document upload, verification, and contract signing.

The project includes:
- A responsive frontend for customers.
- A backend API with authentication and database integration.
- (Planned) An admin dashboard for CRUD operations and order management.
